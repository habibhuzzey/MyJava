//Problem: User interaction doesn't provide desired results.
//Solution: Add interactivity so user can among tasks.
//First, I'll add an event handler to the add button to add new tasks.
var addButton = document.getElementByClassName(add);
addButton.onclick = addTask();
var addTask = function(){
  //display new task in to do list section. 
    
}
//Secondly, the new added task has to be shown on the to-do list part.
//Be able to edit and delete tasks. add event handlers for both buttons.
//Add completed tasks to the completed task list.
